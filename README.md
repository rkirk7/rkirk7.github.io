<h1>Regan Kirk's Porftolio Website</hi>

<h2>Description</h2>

This website was developed to act as my portfolio as part of the MITxEmeritus course. I recently refactored the portfolio to allow for routing between pages to improve the user experience and simplify the navbar.

<h2>Support</h2>

For help with this portfolio, please contact regan.kirk@gmail.com.

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

For this portfolio, I will be creating numerous projects as part of my coursework. I will also continue to refine the style of the portfolio.

<h2>License</h2>

Individual projects that require licensing will have their own licensing information.
