    <p class="about">I am an English professor and TaeKwonDo instructor near Orlando, Florida; in my past life, I was a corporate lawyer in New York City. I have a B.A. from the University of Washington in English and economics, a J.D. from Yale University, and an M.F.A. in creative writing from Columbia University. I am currently a student in the <a href="https://executive-ed.xpro.mit.edu/professional-certificate-coding-womens-cohort" class="link-underline-dark" target="_blank">MITxPro Emeritus course Professional Certificate in Coding - For Women</a>. My first app, “ETA Tournaments”, for managing TaeKwonDo tournaments, can be found in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eta-tournaments/id6446252775" class="link-underline-dark" target="_blank">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kirk.etatournaments&pcampaignid=web_share" class="link-underline-dark" target="_blank">Google Play</a>. </p>

    <p class="about">I travel often, constantly seeking out beautiful locales and outdoor adventures. (This picture is from the four-day W Trek in Torres Del Paine National Park in Chile.) I am an avid writer, with several novels and one musical in my repertoire, and when I was seven years old I won a national contest to invent and publish a board game. I moonlight occasionally as a pianist at a local establishment. An adorable goldendoodle and ornery parrot always keep me on my toes!</p>
