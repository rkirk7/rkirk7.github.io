    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently an English professor and TaeKwonDo instructor near Orlando, Florida; in my past life, I was a corporate litigator in New York City. My first app, “ETA Tournaments”, for managing TaeKwonDo tournaments, can be found in the Apple App Store and Google Play. I am an avid writer, with several novels and one musical in my repertoire, and when I was seven years old I won a national contest to invent and publish a board game. An adorable goldendoodle and ornery parrot always keep me on my toes.</p>
