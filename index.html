    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am an English professor and TaeKwonDo instructor near Orlando, Florida; in my past life, I was a corporate litigator in New York City. My first app, “ETA Tournaments”, for managing TaeKwonDo tournaments, can be found in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eta-tournaments/id6446252775" style="color:#FFFFFF">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kirk.etatournaments&pcampaignid=web_share"  style="color:#FFFFFF">Google Play</a>. I travel often, constantly seeking out beautiful locales and outdoor adventures. (This picture is from the four-day W Trek in Torres Del Paine National Park in Chile.) I am an avid writer, with several novels and one musical in my repertoire, and when I was seven years old I won a national contest to invent and publish a board game. An adorable goldendoodle and ornery parrot always keep me on my toes.</p>
